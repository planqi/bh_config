How to have BH loaded on D2 start
===

* Backup your D2Win.dll
* Replace it with the file hosted here
* Ensure BH.dll, Storm.dll and BH.cfg are in Diablo's root directory
* Add D2Template.dll to Diablo's root directory
* Run game normally

If you ever want BH to not inject just remove BH.dll or D2Template.dll from the root directory
